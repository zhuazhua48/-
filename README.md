# Beautygan-pytorch
adapted from wtjiang

This is the first time I use github to upload my code. It is a bit difficult for me. Ah, what's this ? Ah, what's that?
All the code is from wtjiang. The only thing I do is putting all his files together into four .py files.

You need to download the orignal MT-dataset.(You can find it in the paper:Beautygan).
